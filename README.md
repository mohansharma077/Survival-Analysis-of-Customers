# Survival-Analysis-of-Customers
<h2>What is survival analysis?</h2>
<p>Customer survival analysis, also known as customer churn analysis or customer attrition analysis, is a technique used in machine learning and data analytics to predict and understand when and why customers are likely to stop using a product or service. The goal of customer survival analysis is to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain their customers.</p>

<p>In customer survival analysis, historical data about customer interactions, transactions, and behaviors are analyzed to build predictive models. These models estimate the probability of a customer churning within a specific time period, such as the next month or quarter. By examining various customer characteristics and behaviors, such as demographics, purchase history, customer service interactions, usage patterns, and engagement metrics, the models can identify factors that are strongly correlated with customer churn.</p>

<h3>Customer Churn </h3> 
<p>Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your companyâ€™s product or service during a certain time frame. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers you lost during that time period by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that time period</p>

<h3>What are different types of customer churn survival analysis?</h3>

| Type of Customer Churn Survival Analysis | Description                                              |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Cox Proportional Hazards Model           | A statistical model used to analyze the relationship     |
|                                         | between customer characteristics and the hazard rate of   |
|                                         | churn over time. It estimates the relative risk of churn |
|                                         | associated with various factors.                         |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Kaplan-Meier Estimator                   | A non-parametric method used to estimate the survival    |
|                                         | function, which represents the probability of a customer |
|                                         | surviving (not churning) over time. It can be used to    |
|                                         | compare survival rates between different customer        |
|                                         | segments.                                                |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Random Survival Forest                   | An extension of random forest algorithms for survival    |
|                                         | analysis. It combines decision trees with survival       |
|                                         | analysis techniques to predict customer churn            |
|                                         | probabilities over time. It can handle both categorical  |
|                                         | and continuous features effectively.                     |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Deep Learning Models                     | Neural network models, such as recurrent neural networks |
|                                         | (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can    |
|                                         | be applied to analyze sequential customer data, such as  |
|                                         | time series of customer interactions or behaviors, to    |
|                                         | predict churn probabilities at different time intervals. |
